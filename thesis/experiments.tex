Unfortunately the tool is not yet ready to perform an whole analysis. Instead we can approximate a program using the approach of chapter \ref{chap:Implementation}.

The performance are critical since for one analysis (a desugared JavaScript file of 100 rows of code correspond to 10000 \ljs\ rows) takes from 6 to 8 hours. We plan to enhance performance using lazy approach stated in \cite{TAJS, TAJSDOM, TAJSLazy}.
